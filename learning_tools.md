# Activities to enhance student learning. 

----

## Learning Journals (LJ)
An electronic document where you will be writing responses and reflections to certain in-class activities. This will be checked off periodically for quality and completeness. 


## Question Formulation Technique (QFT)
The backbone of the scientific process is asking and trying to answer questions. This activity will help students learn how to brainstorm and ask questions freely, how to work with open and close ended questions, and what they can learn from asking questions. 

**General process**: 

1. You will be presented with a Question Focus. 
2. In a group you will produce questions about the focus topic using some guiding rules (displayed overhead during the activity). 
3. Work with closed and open ended questions. 
4. As a group you will prioritize questions. 
5. Share your top 3 questions in a shared group document. 
    - with rational why they are your top 3 
6. (After class) Reflect on the activity. 
    - Review the class-wide responses and comment on similarities and differences between your group and other groups top 3.
    - What did you learn during this exercise? 
    - How did you learn that?

## Quizzes (Qz)
Quizzes are a great way to test yourself, enhance recall, and self-assess your comprehension of the subject. Quizzes are administered in Google Forms, and done in two parts.

1. **Individual**: First try to answer as many questions without looking at your notes. Then use your notes to answer the rest. 

2. **Group**: After the individual quiz closes I will choose 1-4 questions that scored the lowest. We will do a class-wide discussion of those topics, then you will work in groups to redo the selected questions for half credit.
